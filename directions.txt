In status-board environment.

1. make rebuild-database 
2. ./status-board serve --enable-ocm-mock

In Terminal:

3. Make a new directory
4. git clone https://github.com/billfitzgerald0120/TestScripts
 and run from there

./runtests.sh Fred

or

 ./runtests.sh Fred 2 Y 

Loglevel set to 2 above (0-5)
Skip Deletes set to Y (only option is Y to skip)

cat error.txt | more - To list errors
cat info.txt | more - For info
cat stats.txt - Historical csv file

run as many as you like, just change the name (Fred).

I have included an optional sql query that displays some of the info.
It should match your environment.

psql -d status-board -U status-board-user -f "${PWD}/get_services.sql"
